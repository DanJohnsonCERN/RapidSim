RapidSim can be useful for generating background (or even toy data sets
for acceptance studies).

* It uses TGenPhaseSpace to generate b events.
* FONLL is used to boost the b.
* The daughter particle momenta are smeared correctly.
* Cuts can be made on daughter particle properties.
* There are tools to swap mass hypothesis.


---SETUP---

Now moved to using CMake to compile a binary. To build do the following:

mkdir build
cd build
cmake ../ -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=/cvmfs/lhcb.cern.ch/lib/lcg/releases/LCG_79/gcc/4.9.3/x86_64-slc6/bin/gcc -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=/cvmfs/lhcb.cern.ch/lib/lcg/releases/LCG_79/gcc/4.9.3/x86_64-slc6/bin/g++
make

The usage is

src/RapidSim.exe <decay mode> <events to generate> <save tree?>

To run an example try

src/RapidSim.exe ../src/Bs2Jpsiphi 10000 1


---DECAYS---

To generate a new decay mode you must write a .decay file using the following syntax:

* particles are named according to config/particles.dat and separated by spaces
* a decay is denoted by ->
* subdecays are demarcated by braces {}

e.g. Bs0 -> { Jpsi -> mu+ mu- } { phi -> K+ K- }


When RapidSim is first run for a new decay mode it will generate a simple .config file.
These files allow properties of the particles and global settings to be configured for each decay.
Run RapidSim with 0 events to generate if you just want to produce the .config file.


---CONFIGURATION---

Global settings should be defined at the start of the file using the syntax:
<setting> : <value>

Particle settings should be defined after the corresponding @# tag using the same syntax.

The following settings are available:

GLOBAL

seed :
	Sets the seed for the random number generator
	n.b. defaults to 4357

acceptance :
	Sets the type of geometric acceptance to apply to the decay
	Options are "Any", "MotherIn", "AllIn" and "AllDownstream"
	n.b. defaults to "Any"

energy :
	Sets the pp collision energy (in TeV) used to get the correct mother kinematics
	n.b. currently "7", "8", "13" and "14" are supported
	more types may be added in rootfiles/fonll

mother :
	Overrides to determined flavour of the mother particle used to get the correct mother kinematics
	n.b. currently only "b" and "c" are supported
	more types may be added in rootfiles/fonll

minWidth :
	Sets the minimum resonance width (in GeV) to be generated
	Narrower resonances will be generated with a fixed mass
	n.b. defaults to 0.001 GeV

maxAttempts :
	Sets the maximum number of attempts allowed to generate each decay
	n.b. defaults to 1000

paramsStable :
	Defines the set of parameters to be added to the histograms/tree
	for each stable particle in the decay.
	Syntax is "paramsStable : <params>"
	where params is a space separated list of the types defined 
	in the PARAMETERS section.
	e.g. "paramsStable : P PT"

paramsDecaying :
	Defines the set of parameters to be added to the histograms/tree
	for each decaying particle in the decay.
	Syntax is "paramsDecaying : <params>"
	where params is a space separated list of the types defined 
	in the PARAMETERS section.
	e.g. "paramsDecaying : M P PT"

paramsTwoBody :
	Defines the set of parameters to be added to the histograms/tree
	for each two-body combination of particles in a 3+-body decay.
	Syntax is "paramsTwoBody : <params>"
	where params is a space separated list of the types defined 
	in the PARAMETERS section.
	e.g. "paramsTwoBody : M M2"

paramsThreeBody :
	Defines the set of parameters to be added to the histograms/tree
	for each three-body combination of particles in a 4+-body decay.
	Syntax is "paramsThreeBody : <params>"
	where params is a space separated list of the types defined 
	in the PARAMETERS section.
	e.g. "paramsThreeBody : M M2"

param :
	Defines a new parameter to be added to the histograms/tree
	Syntax is "param : <name> <type> <particles> [TRUE]"
	where <type> must be one of the types defined in the PARAMETERS section,
	<particles> is a space separated list of particle indices
	and the optional TRUE argument means the parameter will be calculated using the true unsmeared momenta of the particles
	e.g. "param : mSq12 M2 1 2 TRUE"

cut :
	Applys a cut on a given parameter
	Syntax is "cut : <param> <type> <min/max> [<max>]"
	where <param> is the name of a parameter (must be defined using param)
	<type> is one of "min", "max", "range" or "veto"
	and <min> and/or <max> define(s) the cut value(s)

shape :
	Sets a 1D or 2D PDF to generate events according to
	Syntax is "shape : <file> <hist> <paramX> [<paramY>]
	where <file> is the file containing the histogram,
	<hist> is the name of the histogram,
	<paramX> is the name of the parameter on the X-axis (must be defined using param)
	and for 2D histograms <paramY> is the name of the parameter on the Y-axis
	n.b. RapidSim supports TH1F, TH1D, TH2F and TH2D histograms,
	The dimensionality of the histogram will be inferred from the number of parameters given
	Defaults to phase-space distribution


PARTICLE

name :
	A user-friendly name for this particle to be used in variable names
	n.b. defaults to automatically generated unique name of particle

smear :
	The type of momentum smearing to apply to this particle
	Standard types are "generic" or "electron"
	More types may be defined in config/smear
	n.b. defaults to "electron" for electrons/positrons, otherwise "generic"

invisible :
	Whether the particle should be treated as invisible
	Invisible particles are not included when determining non-truth parameters
	A corrected mass parameter will be added automatically if any particles are invisible
	n.b. defaults to "true" for neutrinos, otherwise "false"

altMass :
	Adds alternative mass hypotheses for this particle
	Syntax is "altMass : <particles>"
	where particles is a space separated list of particle type
	names as listed in config/particles.dat
	If alternative hypotheses are defined for multiple particles
	then parameters will be calculated for all combinations of
	one or two mis-identifications
