FastSim can be useful for generating background (or even toy data sets
for acceptance studies).

* It uses TGenPhaseSpace to generate b events.
* FONLL is used to boost the b.
* The daughter particle momenta are smeared correctly.
* Cuts can be made on daughter particle properties.
* There are tools to swap mass hypothesis.

Now moved to using CMake to compile a binary. To build do the following:

mkdir build
cd build
cmake ../ -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=/cvmfs/lhcb.cern.ch/lib/lcg/releases/LCG_79/gcc/4.9.3/x86_64-slc6/bin/gcc -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=/cvmfs/lhcb.cern.ch/lib/lcg/releases/LCG_79/gcc/4.9.3/x86_64-slc6/bin/g++
make

To run the binary do

src/FastSim.exe 0 10000 ../rootfiles

TODO

Make the code more generic to allow different decays to be easily configured.
